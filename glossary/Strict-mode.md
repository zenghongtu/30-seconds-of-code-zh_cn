### Strict mode

JavaScript's strict mode is a JavaScript feature that allows developers to use a more restrictive variant of JavaScript and it can be enabled by adding `'use strict';` at the very top of their code.
Strict mode elimiated some silent errors, might improve performance and changes the behavior of `eval` and `arguments` among other things.
